# Content Validity Index Module for Jamovi
# DEVELOPING STAGE

## Overview

The Content Validity Index (CVI) module is designed to assist researchers and practitioners in calculating key metrics related to content validity. This module is specifically tailored for Jamovi, an open-source statistical software, and provides an easy-to-use interface for calculating the following indices:

- **I-CVI (Item-level Content Validity Index)**: Measures the proportion of experts who agree on the relevance of each item.
- **UA (Universal Agreement among experts)**: Represents the percentage of items that have universal agreement among experts.
- **S-CVI/Ave (Scale-level Content Validity Index, Average method)**: Calculates the average of I-CVIs across all items.
- **S-CVI/UA (Scale-level Content Validity Index, Universal Agreement method)**: Measures the proportion of items that achieved universal agreement among experts.

1. Open [Jamovi version 2.6.13](https://www.jamovi.org/downloads/jamovi-2.6.13.0-win-x64.exe) or version [2.3.28 (solid)](https://www.jamovi.org/downloads/jamovi-2.3.28.0-win64.exe)
2. Download the [cviJmv_0.0.0.jmo](https://github.com/lerlerchan/cviJmv/blob/main/cviJmv_0.0.0.jmo) file 
3. Navigate to the 'Modules' tab.
4. Click on 'Sideload' tab
5. Click on the 'Arrow logo', select the downloaded jmo file.
6. Click 'Open' to add the module to your Jamovi environment.
   
### Future plan of Installation (it will take some time to be process)
1. Open Jamovi version 2.5.6 or version 2.3.28 (solid)
2. Navigate to the 'Modules' tab.
3. Search for "Content Validity Index".
4. Click 'Install' to add the module to your Jamovi environment.

## Usage

1. After installation, the module can be accessed from the 'Analyses' tab in Jamovi.
2. Input your data, ensuring that it is formatted according to the module's specifications.
3. Select the indices you wish to calculate.
4. Click 'Run' to generate your results.

## Example

Below is a simple example of how to use the module:

1. **Input Data**: Enter the item relevance ratings from your panel of experts.
2. **Select Analysis**: Choose to calculate I-CVI, UA, S-CVI/Ave, and S-CVI/UA.
3. **View Results**: The results will display the calculated indices and any associated statistics.
