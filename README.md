# Content Validity Index Module for Jamovi
# DEVELOPING STAGE

## Overview

The Content Validity Index (CVI) module is designed to assist researchers and practitioners in calculating key metrics related to content validity. This module is specifically tailored for Jamovi, an open-source statistical software, and provides an easy-to-use interface for calculating the following indices:

- **I-CVI (Item-level Content Validity Index)**: Measures the proportion of experts who agree on the relevance of each item.
- **UA (Universal Agreement among experts)**: Represents the percentage of items that have universal agreement among experts.
- **S-CVI/Ave (Scale-level Content Validity Index, Average method)**: Calculates the average of I-CVIs across all items.
- **S-CVI/UA (Scale-level Content Validity Index, Universal Agreement method)**: Measures the proportion of items that achieved universal agreement among experts.
